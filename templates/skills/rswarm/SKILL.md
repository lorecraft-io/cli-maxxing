# Ruflo Advanced Swarm — Immediate Execution

When this skill is invoked, IMMEDIATELY launch a 15-agent swarm. Do NOT explain how swarms work. Do NOT show code examples. Do NOT ask clarifying questions unless the task is truly ambiguous. ACT.

## Execution Steps

1. Read the user's task (everything they typed after `/rswarm`)
2. **Signal status line**: Run `echo 15 > /tmp/ruflo-swarm-active` via Bash to light up the 🐝 indicator
3. Initialize the swarm in ONE message:
   - Call `mcp__ruflo__swarm_init` with topology `hierarchical-mesh`, maxAgents 15, strategy `specialized` (skip if the Ruflo MCP tool isn't available — the Agent-tool spawn below is what actually does the work)
   - Spawn ALL 15 agents via the Agent tool with `run_in_background: true` — every agent in ONE message
4. After spawning, STOP. Do not poll. Do not check status. Wait for agents to return.
5. When results come back, synthesize and present the combined output.
6. **Clear status line**: Run `rm -f /tmp/ruflo-swarm-active` via Bash to turn off the 🐝 indicator

## The 15 Agents

| # | Agent Type | Role | Task Focus |
|---|-----------|------|------------|
| 1 | system-architect | Lead Architect | System design, task decomposition, coordinates all agents |
| 2 | coder | Backend Dev 1 | Core backend implementation |
| 3 | coder | Backend Dev 2 | Secondary backend / services |
| 4 | coder | Frontend Dev | UI / frontend implementation |
| 5 | backend-dev | DB Engineer | Schema, queries, data layer |
| 6 | tester | Test Engineer 1 | Unit + integration tests |
| 7 | tester | Test Engineer 2 | E2E + edge case tests |
| 8 | security-auditor | Security Auditor | Vulnerability scanning, input validation, secrets check |
| 9 | performance-engineer | Perf Engineer | Bottleneck analysis, optimization |
| 10 | reviewer | Code Reviewer | Quality, patterns, best practices |
| 11 | researcher | Researcher | Background research, prior art, docs lookup |
| 12 | analyst | Code Analyst | Architecture assessment, dependency analysis |
| 13 | coder | DevOps Engineer | CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure |
| 14 | coder | Technical Writer | Documentation, README, usage guides |
| 15 | tester | QA Coordinator | Final validation, cross-agent consistency check |

Adapt agent assignments to the task — not every task needs all 15 roles. If the task is frontend-only, shift agent roles accordingly. But ALWAYS spawn 15.

## Rules

- Model: Opus only. Never route to Haiku or Sonnet.
- Topology: hierarchical-mesh (architect leads, agents coordinate peer-to-peer within their layer)
- All agents spawned in background in ONE message
- Each agent gets a clear, specific sub-task with full context — not vague instructions
- After spawning, STOP and wait
- When results arrive, review ALL results before presenting final output
